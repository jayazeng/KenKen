# KenKen
Project for COMP 560: Artificial Intelligence

Task: Implement algorithims (backtracking and local search) to solve KenKen puzzles using Java

Additional Notes: 

Input for puzzle will give the size of the puzzle, the partitioning of the puzzle in row major order   using letters and the equations associated with each partitions. So the input for a puzzle will look like:
        6
        ABBCDD
        AEECFD
        GGHHFD
        GGIJKK
        LLIJJM
        NNNOOM
        A:11+
        B:2/
        C:20*
        D:6*
        E:3-
        F:3+
        G:240*
        H:6*
        I:6*
        J:7+
        K:30*
        L:6*
        M:9+
        N:8+
        O:2/ 

Output for puzzle should be the solutions and the number of nodes/iterations for the each of the solutions.
